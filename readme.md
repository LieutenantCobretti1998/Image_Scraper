Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code

To guide users in installing the necessary environment from an `env.yml` file, you should include instructions in the README.md file of your project. An `env.yml` file is typically used with Conda, a popular package and environment management system. Below, I'll add a section to your README.md explaining how users can install the environment from your `env.yml` file:

## Environment Setup

This project uses Conda for managing its environment and dependencies. To set up the environment using the provided `env.yml` file, follow these steps:

1. **Install Conda**:
    - If you don't have Conda installed, [download and install](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) either Anaconda or Miniconda.

2. **Create the Conda Environment**:
    - Navigate to the directory containing the `env.yml` file.
    - Run the following command to create a Conda environment from the `env.yml` file:
      ```bash
      conda env create -f env.yml
      ```
    - This command will create a new Conda environment with the name and dependencies specified in `env.yml`.

3. **Activate the Environment**:
    - Once the environment is created, activate it using:
      ```bash
      conda activate [environment_name]
      ```
    - Replace `[environment_name]` with the name of the environment specified in the `env.yml` file.

4. **Verify the Environment**:
    - After activation, you can verify that the correct environment is being used by running:
      ```bash
      conda env list
      ```
    - The active environment will be shown with an asterisk (*).

Once the environment is set up and activated, you can proceed to run the Unsplash Image Scraper as detailed in the [Usage](#usage) section.
