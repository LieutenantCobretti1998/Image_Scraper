**Unsplash Image Scraper**

**Description**

The Unsplash Image Scraper is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to download high-quality images from Unsplash based on user-specified topics, resolutions, and quantities.Description
The scrape_with_api function is a custom-built scraper for fetching image URLs from Unsplash based on a given search query. It takes two arguments: the number of images to retrieve and the search term (name of the image category).

**Important Note**

This function does not use the official Unsplash API and is not endorsed by Unsplash. It was created for educational purposes and should be used responsibly and ethically, respecting Unsplash's terms of service. For regular and compliant use, consider using Unsplash's official API with an API key.

How It Works
Input Parameters:

images_number: An integer representing the number of images you want to scrape.
name: A string representing the search term or category of images.
Request and Response:

The function constructs a URL to send a request to Unsplash's search endpoint.
It uses custom headers to mimic a web browser request.
Data Extraction:

The function processes the JSON response to extract the full image URLs and their descriptions.
Return Value:

Returns a dictionary where keys are image descriptions and values are the corresponding image URLs.

**Key Features**


Customizable Searches: Specify the topic or theme of the images you want to download.
Resolution Selection: Choose your desired resolution for the images.
Quantity Control: Define the number of images you wish to scrape using the API function.
Automatic Download: Images are downloaded and saved directly to your local computer.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.11.4

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [URL to this repository]
cd [repository name]
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

To guide users in installing the necessary environment from an `env.yml` file, you should include instructions in the README.md file of your project. An `env.yml` file is typically used with Conda, a popular package and environment management system. Below, I'll add a section to your README.md explaining how users can install the environment from your `env.yml` file:

## Environment Setup

This project uses Conda for managing its environment and dependencies. To set up the environment using the provided `env.yml` file, follow these steps:

1. **Install Conda**:
    - If you don't have Conda installed, [download and install](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) either Anaconda or Miniconda.

2. **Create the Conda Environment**:
    - Navigate to the directory containing the `env.yml` file.
    - Run the following command to create a Conda environment from the `env.yml` file:
      ```bash
      conda env create -f env.yml
      ```
    - This command will create a new Conda environment with the name and dependencies specified in `env.yml`.

3. **Activate the Environment**:
    - Once the environment is created, activate it using:
      ```bash
      conda activate [environment_name]
      ```
    - Replace `[environment_name]` with the name of the environment specified in the `env.yml` file.

4. **Verify the Environment**:
    - After activation, you can verify that the correct environment is being used by running:
      ```bash
      conda env list
      ```
    - The active environment will be shown with an asterisk (*).

Once the environment is set up and activated, you can proceed to run the Unsplash Image Scraper as detailed in the [Usage](#usage) section.
